# LAPD-Crime-Analysis-and-Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes crime data reported by the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)** using publicly available datasets from **data.gov**. It provides insights into crime patterns, trends over time, and victim demographics through **data visualization and SQL-based queries**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Crime Trend Analysis:** Monthly, yearly, and weekday crime patterns.
- 📌 **Crime Category Insights:** Breakdown of crime types (Theft, Violent Crimes, Fraud, etc.).
- ⏳ **Peak Crime Hours:** Identifies the most common crime occurrence times.
- 📍 **Geographical Crime Distribution:** Top and bottom crime-prone areas in LA.
- 🔍 **Case Status Insights:** Investigation status distribution of reported crimes.
- 👥 **Victim Demographics:** Analysis by age, gender, and ethnic background.
- 📄 **SQL Query Outputs:** Optimized queries to extract meaningful crime statistics.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)
- **Data Processed From:** `processed_bi` table (cleaned and structured data for analysis)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Jupyter Notebook** (Data Processing - `bi_data_processing.ipynb`)
- **SQL** (Data Extraction - `queries.sql`)
- **Python** (Data Analysis & Visualization)
- **Power BI** (Dashboard Representation)

## 📊 Visualizations

Key insights are displayed using **interactive dashboards** (Power BI/Tableau). Some examples include:

- **Total Reports by Crime Category**
- **Total Reports by Weekday**
- **Case Status Distribution**
- **Crime Trends Over Time** (Yearly, Monthly, Hourly Analysis)
- **Crime Victim Analysis**

## 📌 SQL Queries Used

Below are some key SQL queries used in the analysis:

```sql
-- Total Reports in the Database
SELECT COUNT(report_id) AS total_reports FROM processed_bi;

-- Crime Reports Grouped by Category
SELECT crime_category, COUNT(report_id) AS total_reports
FROM processed_bi
GROUP BY crime_category
ORDER BY total_reports DESC;

-- Peak Crime Hours
WITH HourlyReports AS (
    SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, time_of_occurrence) AS report_hour, COUNT(report_id) AS total_reports
    FROM processed_bi
    GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, time_of_occurrence)
)
SELECT report_hour, total_reports FROM HourlyReports ORDER BY total_reports DESC;
```

Full SQL query set can be found in **`queries.sql`**.

## 🏗️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanzim09/LAPD-Crime-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   pip install holidays
   ```
3. Open `bi_data_processing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute all cells.
4. Execute SQL queries in a database environment with LAPD crime data.
5. Load Power BI dashboard for interactive analysis.
